# .VIM

This is my current `Vim` configuration.

Since I'm using it on different machines, it should be always up to date.

## Features

Here is a list of features:

- Sets the leader to `;`.
- Apply some formatting.
- Cleanup the layout.
- Easy window switching.
- Uses `Ctrlp` for file searching.
- Add `Ag` plugin for text searching.
- Add _remove trailing whitespaced_ macro.

## Installation

Clone this repo and save it as the .vim folder.

```
git clone git@github.com:fousa/.vim.git ~/.vim
```

Make sure you remove the `~/.vimrc` file because it will be used instead of my `~/.vim/vimrc`.

## License

None.
